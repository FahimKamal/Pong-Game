# Pong-Game
My First Python program
I used turtle module to create this program.

The game has two paddle, paddle_a and paddle_b and a ball. The ball goes around from right to left and player have to catch the ball before it hits the wall, otherwise oposite player gets a point.

The game plays sound upon hiting the wall.
