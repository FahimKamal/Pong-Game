# Pong-Game
My First Python program.

I used turtle module to create this program.

# Multi-player 
The game has two paddle, paddle_a and paddle_b and a ball. The ball goes around from right to left and player have to catch the ball before it hits the wall, otherwise oposite player gets a point.

# Single Player
Now the game has just one paddle. Game starts with 3 lifes. If player catchs the ball gets a point but if not lose a life. If all life is lost the game is over.

The game plays sound upon hiting the wall.
